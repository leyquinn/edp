    <p>The Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) has successfully completed preventive maintenance works along two (2) sections of the Liloy-Siocon Road in the municipality of Baliguian, Zamboanga del Norte.<br><br>
        Implemented by DPWH Zamboanga del Norte 4th District Engineering Office, the completed projects consist of a 4-kilometer road concreting along Barangay Tan-awan, and a 1-kilometer asphalt overlay along Barangay Kauswagan.<br><br>
        “These initiatives are part of the Department’s ongoing commitment to President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr.’s “Bagong Pilipinas” vision which aims to establish more efficient, durable and sustainable road networks across the country,” said DPWH-IX Director Cayamombao Dia.<br><br>
        According to Director Dia, locals are grateful for the paved road in Barangay Tan-awan as they no longer have to pass through a dusty and uneven road surface, making travel faster, safer, and more convenient.<br><br>
        With swift and cost-efficient movement of people and goods, agricultural communities and small businesses are expected to benefit from the completed project, which will help spur the economic development of not only the barangay, but the entire municipality.<br><br>
        Meanwhile, the existing concrete pavement road in Barangay Kauswagan has been reinforced with 280-millimeter thick asphalt to address surface deterioration caused by heavy traffic and adverse weather conditions, enhancing road safety and prolonging its service life.<br><br>
        The upgraded road now improves transport access to basic goods and services, health centers, and other public and private establishments, ensuring a more reliable roadway for motorists traversing the area.<br><br>
        Besides overlaying of asphalt, other works on the project also included road reblocking and installation of streetlights as a safety feature.<br><br>
        The road paving and asphalting projects were implemented in the amount of P54.5 million and P28.3 million, respectively.<br><br></p>
